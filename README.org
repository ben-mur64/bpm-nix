* My Personal NixOS and Home-Manager config

Eventual configuration home for all of my NixOS and non-NixOS machines.

** Directory Structure
Although it's still a work in progress, the eventual folder structure is as follows:

*** Systems
This contains system-specific configuration for each of the NixOS machines that I managed.
Currently, we just have the Lappy, but more are incoming.

**** TODO command-center
**** TODO home-server
**** TODO work macbook

*** Users
This contains home-manager configuration for user-level programs that I want on every machine.

**** TODO bpm

** Installation
To rebuild the installation for the <hostname> system:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake '.#<hostname>'
#+END_SRC

To rebuild the installation for the <user> user:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
sudo home-manager switch --flake '.#<user>'
#+END_SRC
